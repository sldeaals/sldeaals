## Experience
Throughout my career, I've held roles as a team leader, mentor, and project manager. With over 5 years of experience, I've specialized as a full-stack developer, with a primary focus on backend development, supplemented by over 3 years of frontend development expertise. My professional journey has predominantly involved collaboration with SaaS companies. Since 2019, I've transitioned to remote work, occasionally adopting a hybrid model when needed.
I have experience working in diverse teams ranging from 5 to 30+ people, where collaboration and support are paramount.
My work has taken me to different countries, including the Dominican Republic, Russia, Ukraine, the UAE, and Colombia, where I have worked physically. Additionally, I have collaborated with teams based remotely in Chile, Argentina, and the United States.

## Crypto Enthusiast
I am deeply passionate about cryptocurrency, currently my favorite niche. I am actively studying technologies such as blockchain, smart contracts, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and more. My focus is on developing DApps, crypto payment gateways, digital wallets, trading platforms, and other innovative solutions.
